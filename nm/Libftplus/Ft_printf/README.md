# What I've Created

In this project, I have created a custom implementation of the standard C library function `printf()`, which I've called `ft_printf()`. This function aims to mimic the functionality of the original `printf()` but is built from scratch. My implementation handles a subset of format specifiers like `%c`, `%s`, `%p`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, and `%%`.

The project also includes a Makefile that manages the build process, compiling the necessary `.c` files into an archive library `libftprintf.a`. I've strictly followed the C Norm standards set by the school and ensured there are no memory leaks.

# What I've Learned

## Understanding of Variadic Functions
This project provided me with the opportunity to work with variadic functions in C, a powerful feature that allows functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments.

## String and Character Manipulation
Through implementing specifiers like `%c` and `%s`, I gained a deeper understanding of how to manipulate characters and strings in C.

## Memory Management
I have further sharpened my skills in memory management using `malloc` and `free` while ensuring there are no memory leaks in the application.

## Base Conversions
Implementing `%x` and `%X` helped me understand the intricacies of number base conversions in C.

## Build Process
The Makefile construction process made me familiar with compiling multi-file C programs, linking, and archive creation.

## Code Structure
The need for a well-structured and extensible codebase was evident throughout the project, which has improved my architectural skills in software development.

## Debugging and Testing
I've also learned to develop a suite of test cases to ensure the function behaves as expected, which is essential for debugging and validation.

By completing this project, I feel more confident in my C programming skills, memory management, and understanding of complex features like variadic functions.
